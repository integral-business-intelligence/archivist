# Archivist

Archivist is a free Windows desktop application that lets you use AI to search, understand, and work with your own documents — without an internet connection, without an account, and without your files ever leaving your computer.

## Why Archivist?

AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude are genuinely useful. But using them with your own documents comes with real tradeoffs that most people don't think about until it's too late.

### The Problem with Cloud AI

**You need an account — and often a subscription.**
Most capable AI tools require sign-up, and the best ones sit behind a paywall or usage limits. The cost adds up, and access can be cut off.

**Your documents leave your computer.**
To ask an AI about a file, you have to upload it. That means your contracts, medical records, financial statements, or personal notes are now on someone else's server. You're trusting a company's privacy policy — and hoping their security holds.

**You're choosing between privacy and capability.**
The more sensitive the document, the more you need help with it, and the less comfortable you should feel uploading it. With cloud AI, you're constantly making that tradeoff.

### How Archivist Is Different

Archivist runs entirely on your machine. The AI model, the document processing, the search — all of it happens locally. There's nothing to sign up for, no usage meter ticking, and no server receiving your files.

| | Cloud AI | Archivist |
|---|---|---|
| Requires account | Yes | No |
| Subscription or usage fees | Often | No |
| Documents uploaded to a server | Yes | Never |
| Works offline | No | Yes |
| Free to use | Limited | Yes |

## What Makes Archivist Easy to Use

Most local AI tools are built for developers. They require installing multiple pieces of software, configuring settings files, and troubleshooting technical problems before you ever get to use them. Archivist is different.

**One installer.** Download and run a single file — everything Archivist needs is included. No separate downloads, no command line, no configuration.

**Everything in one place.** Voice transcription, document conversion, AI chat, and your document library are all part of the same application. You don't need different tools for different tasks.

**Free to use — fully.** Every feature in Archivist is available at no cost. For users who want to experiment with larger or more capable AI models, an optional upgrade unlocks the ability to add them — but the full application works completely without it.

**Runs on regular hardware.** Archivist is designed for everyday laptops, not servers or high-end workstations. The included AI model is chosen to run well on typical Windows machines.

## What Can You Do with Archivist?

### Chat with Your Documents Using AI

Add your documents to Archivist and ask questions in plain English. Summarize a lengthy report, find a specific detail buried in a contract, compare information across multiple files, or ask the AI to help you draft something based on your own notes.

Archivist searches your documents for the most relevant information and passes it to the AI, so the answers are grounded in what you've actually written — not general knowledge from the internet.

> **File Sets** let you organize your documents into focused groups — a project, a client, a topic — so you can direct your questions at exactly the right collection of files.

### You Stay in Control

With Archivist, you decide what documents the AI can access. You choose what goes in, you can remove anything at any time, and nothing is shared with anyone. There's no black box — your library is yours to organize however makes sense to you.

This makes Archivist well-suited for sensitive material: legal documents, personal health records, financial files, private research, or anything you wouldn't be comfortable uploading to a third-party service.

### Voice to Text

Archivist includes a built-in voice transcription tool. Speak and your words are converted to text — entirely on your device, no cloud service required. You can save the transcript directly, or pass it to the AI to clean it up, reshape it, or expand on it. It works as a standalone tool even if you never use the document library.

### Document Conversion and Export

Archivist can extract clean text from over 50 file formats — PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images with text, and more — and convert them to plain Markdown. This works as a standalone utility: if you need clean, portable text from a document for use in another app, Archivist can do that without involving the AI at all.

Both conversion and upload support entire folders at once. Point Archivist at a directory of PDFs and it will convert them all in one pass. Do the same on upload and a whole folder of text or Markdown files lands in your library together. You don't have to process your documents one at a time.

You can also export your entire document library — your files and all the processed text — so your data is never locked in. Take it with you, back it up, or move it to another tool.
