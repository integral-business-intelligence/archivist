# Getting Started with Archivist

This guide will walk you through installing Archivist, getting it set up on first launch, and having your first AI-powered conversation with a document.

---

## Step 1 — Install Archivist

Archivist is available through the Microsoft Store. You can install it directly from the Store app on your PC, or click the badge below to open the installer.

> **Note:** If Windows asks for permission to install the app, click **Yes**. Archivist does not require administrator access after installation.

## Step 2 — First Launch: Model Downloads

When you open Archivist for the first time, it will automatically download three AI models it needs to function:

- **A language model** — the AI that reads your documents and responds to your questions
- **A voice transcription model** — powers the built-in speech-to-text feature
- **An embedding model** — enables Archivist to search your documents by meaning, not just keywords

This download happens once and runs in the background. The models are stored locally on your machine — they are never uploaded or shared anywhere. Depending on your internet connection, this may take a few minutes.

Once the downloads are complete, Archivist is ready to use.

## A Quick Look at the App

Archivist is organized into tabs across the top of the window. Here's a brief overview:

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Query** | Your main workspace — ask questions and chat with your documents |
| **Pre-Process** | Convert documents from their original format into plain text |
| **Upload** | Add converted documents to your library |
| **Browse** | View and manage the files stored in your library |
| **Inspect** | Edit document details and organize files into File Sets |
| **AI Settings** | Adjust how the AI behaves — context, system prompts, and more |
| **Help & Licensing** | Get support, and manage your license if you've purchased an upgrade |

The rest of this guide will walk you through your first workflow using the **Pre-Process**, **Upload**, and **Query** tabs.

## Step 3 — Convert a Document

Before you can chat with a document, Archivist needs to read it. The **Pre-Process** tab handles this — it extracts the text from your file and converts it into a clean, readable format.

1. Click the **Pre-Process** tab.
2. Click **Open File** (or drag your file into the window) and select the document you want to work with. Archivist supports PDFs, Word documents, spreadsheets, images, and [over 50 other formats](supported-formats.md).
3. Archivist will extract the text and display it in the editor. You can review it here before doing anything else.
4. When you're ready, click **Save**. You can save the output as **plain text** (`.txt`) or **Markdown** (`.md`) — either works for the next step. Save it somewhere easy to find, like your Desktop.

> **Tip:** The saved file is a clean, portable copy of your document's text. You can keep it, use it in other apps, or simply use it as an intermediate step before uploading.

## Step 4 — Upload the Document

Now that you have a converted file, add it to your Archivist library.

1. Click the **Upload** tab.
2. Click **Choose File** and select the file you just saved.
3. Give it a name if you'd like, then click **Upload**.

Archivist will process the file and add it to your library. This typically takes a few seconds.

## Step 5 — Start Chatting

With your document in the library, head to the **Query** tab to start asking questions.

1. Click the **Query** tab.
2. In the dropdown menu near the top of the screen, you'll see your document listed. Select it.
3. Type a question in the input field — for example: *"What are the main points of this document?"* or *"Summarize the key dates mentioned."*
4. Press **Enter** (or click **Send**) and Archivist will search your document and respond.

The AI's answers are based on the content of the document you selected. Try a few different questions to get a feel for how it works.

## Working with Multiple Files at Once

The steps above walk through a single document, but Archivist handles folders just as easily.

- On the **Pre-Process** tab, you can select an entire folder instead of a single file. Archivist will convert every supported document in that folder in one pass — useful if you have a collection of PDFs or scanned files you want to bring in together.
- On the **Upload** tab, you can select a folder of text or Markdown files and upload them all at once. This is the fastest way to build up your library from existing documents.

## What's Next?

- **[Using File Sets](file-sets.md)** — Organize multiple documents into focused groups for more targeted queries
- **[Voice to Text](voice-to-text.md)** — Transcribe speech directly into text, then shape it with AI
- **[Supported File Formats](supported-formats.md)** — See the full list of document types Archivist can convert
