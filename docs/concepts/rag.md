# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is like giving an AI assistant access to your personal library of information. Imagine you're asking a smart friend a question—normally, they can only answer based on what they already know. But with RAG, it's as if your friend can quickly search through your documents, find the most relevant information, and use that specific knowledge to give you a better answer. When you use Archivist, the system takes your question, searches through your uploaded files for the most relevant content, and then uses that information to create its response. This means you get answers that are specifically informed by your own documents—whether that's company reports, research papers, or personal notes—rather than just generic information. It's like having an intelligent assistant who has actually read all your important materials and can reference them directly when answering your questions.
