# File Sets

File Sets in Archivist are like creating custom collections in your digital library. Think of them as labeled shelves where you can organize related documents together regardless of their file type or location. 

For example, you might create a "Marketing Strategy" File Set that includes your brand guidelines, recent campaign results, and competitor research. When chatting with the AI, instead of specifying each document individually, you simply select this File Set to have the AI consider all these related materials at once. 

You can have documents belong to multiple File Sets too—just like a book could be categorized under both "Fiction" and "Historical"—giving you flexible ways to organize information based on projects, topics, or departments. 

Every document you upload is automatically added to the "All Docs" File Set, ensuring you always have the option to search across your entire knowledge base with a single selection. This makes conversations more efficient since you don't need to repeatedly select the same group of documents for related questions, and it helps ensure the AI has all the relevant context when answering your questions.
