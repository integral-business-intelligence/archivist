Everything happens locally on your device, giving you full control over your information while still enjoying powerful AI capabilities typically only available through cloud services that require extensive personal data.

- You can download and install the application directly from our website without creating a user account or sharing any personal information—not even an email address.

- When purchasing a paid license, all payment processing is handled securely through Stripe, ensuring that your credit card information is never accessed or stored by us. During the paid license purchase, we ask only for an email address—which can be any address of your choosing, including a non-identifiable one created specifically for this purpose—solely to deliver your license key and maintain your license association, with no requirement to reveal any personal information.

- Conversion of documents to plain text occurs on your local computer. No need to upload files to untrusted websites.
