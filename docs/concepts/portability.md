# Data Portability

Perhaps most importantly, the Integral Archivist approach acknowledges the rapid pace of technological change. ==By maintaining core knowledge in portable, well-structured formats (CSV, TXT, MD), organizations create durable assets that can evolve across technological shifts. The careful work of curation becomes a lasting investment rather than a temporary implementation tied to a specific technical framework.==

When the next generation of AI tools emerges, these well-structured knowledge foundations can be readily transferred, eliminating the need to restart the curation process from scratch. ==This approach respects both the value of human time invested in knowledge organization and the inevitability of technological evolution.==
