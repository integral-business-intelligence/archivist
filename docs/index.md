Archivist is an easy-to-use desktop application that:

1\. Brings local, offline, AI chat capabilities to your personal computer; and<br>
2\. Enables you to safely utilize your own personal/private/proprietary files and documents for the AI to reference

It is designed for people who want to leverage the power of AI without relying on cloud providers.

What makes Archivist special is its ability to learn from your own files and documents. Simply upload any files you wantâ€”like PDFs, Word documents, or text filesâ€”and Archivist makes their content available during your AI conversations. You can ask questions about specific documents or across your entire collection, getting insightful answers based on your personal information. No technical knowledge requiredâ€”just upload your files, ask questions, and get smart responses that draw directly from your own curated library of documents.

!!! info "About the Name"
    An archivist is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to records and archives determined to have long-term value... Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records.

This application serves as a **capability demonstration** rather than a finished product. As system integrators specializing in AI solutions for professional services firms, developing mass-market desktop applications isn't our core business model.

We've made deliberate packaging decisions that prioritize demonstrability over startup speed. The application wraps what would typically be an always-on network service into a distributable format you can try on your own hardware. There is an inherent speed tradeoff with this approach.
